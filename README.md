# floorPlanFinderPlugin
Our client approached us with the desire to have a plugin integrated into their website that allows potential tenants to view bedroom types, level and room number to check availability and find out additional details. 

The code provides a solution using different filters users to select specific items. On the backend, there is a plugin page created that allows the apartment company to select a checkbox that shows whether or not an apartment has been leased or not, which toggles the css code on the front end and changes the styling to show the user that it is, or isn't available. 

I used jQuery to manipulate the classes and was able to accomplish this plugin in about 5 working days.
